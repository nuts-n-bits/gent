in this branch, we try to delay the flt operation. since the flt pass segregates the type expressions into TopLevelType
and TypeExpr, it complicates later operations, and forces minting of new top level symbols repeatedly.

if we could delay flt after we have finished localcheck and linking, then at least at the linking stage, the linker 
could make heavy use of anonymous type definitions which simplifies their jobs massively.
