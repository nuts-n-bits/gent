# This quasi spec describes a format where the bytes are already delimited. 
# The buffers come in with a size property and there is no ambiguity as to where it begins and ends. 
# Within that buffer, the following structure applies.
#

Data Frame = Type A Buffer <or> Type B Buffer
Type A Buffer = Channel Header <concat> Bytes
Type B Buffer = Channel Closure Bytes

Channel Header Example
        let chanids [A,B,C] be the message we want to encode with type A self-delimiting chanid sequence.
        let A = aaaaaa, B = bbbbbb_bbbbbb, C = cccccc_cccccc_cccccc, where lowercase letters are the laid out bit patterns of A, B, and C. (chanids are always bit patterns where bitlength = 6n)
        first, layout every bit in the 6 lsb places of each bytes in order:                __aaaaaa __bbbbbb __bbbbbb __cccccc __cccccc __cccccc
        then, write 1 to the msb of every byte but the last one:                           1_aaaaaa 1_bbbbbb 1_bbbbbb 1_cccccc 1_cccccc 0_cccccc
        then, if a byte is the last byte of a single chanid, write 1 at the second msb:    11aaaaaa 1_bbbbbb 11bbbbbb 1_cccccc 1_cccccc 01cccccc
        otherwise, write 0 at the second msb:                                              11aaaaaa 10bbbbbb 11bbbbbb 10cccccc 10cccccc 01cccccc
        These 6 bytes can be prepended to any message and the first msb will act as a delimiter of where the header ends (0-ends), and the second msb 
        acts as a delimiter for where each chanid ends (1-ends).

Channel Closure Bytes Example 
        let chanid A be the message we want to encode with type B chanid sequence.
        let A = aaaaaa_aaaaaa, where lowercase letters are the laid out bit patterns of A.
        first, layout every bit in the 6 lsb places of each bytes in order: __aaaaaa __aaaaaa
        then, fill 0 at every bit yet-defined:                              00aaaaaa 00aaaaaa
        this message can only contain one single chanid since it does not delimit itself.
        this message cannot be prepended to some other buffer because it does not delimit itself.
        the whole message is just this one chanid.
